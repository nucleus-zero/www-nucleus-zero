# header
Logo to small

# about page

Needs to be a proper single page and styled. I see this as mainly text but would be nice to be stylish. https://formcake.com/blog/adding-a-single-page-to-hugo

# author image
Its stock. Maybe Marks one from the research site ?

# 404
Its stock. Something cool would be, well cool. Something funny. https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/best-404-pages-812505

# favicons

These are defined in

	/themes/nucleus-zero/layouts/partials/_shared/favicons.hml 
	
The actual files go under 

	/layouts/static 
	
# homepage 

1. pull in some featured blog posts on the homepage 
2. centralize the form 
3. Social icons - color ? RSS one icon seems to override with GH

# blog layout
The thumbnail landing page is good I think but the actual single page feels a bit boring. I do like there thumbnail images on the demo https://lgaida.github.io/mediumish-gohugo-theme-demo/blog/ but they are laid out strange and very square on the single post. 

There are some good showcases and all have code.
